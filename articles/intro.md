# Introduction to SDSL

Welcome to the SDSL (Shading Description Shader Language) documentation!

## What is SDSL?

SDSL is an elegant and powerful shading language designed for modern graphics programming. It provides:

- **Intuitive Syntax**: Easy to learn and read
- **Powerful Features**: Advanced shading capabilities
- **Modular Design**: Reusable shader components
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different platforms

## Why Choose SDSL?

SDSL stands out for its elegant approach to shader development:

1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex shaders from simple components
2. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
3. **Performance**: Optimized code generation
4. **Flexibility**: Adapt to different rendering needs

## Example

Here's a simple SDSL shader example:

```hlsl
shader SimpleShader : ShaderBase
{
    stage override void VSMain()
    {
        // Vertex shader code
    }
    
    stage override void PSMain()
    {
        // Pixel shader code
    }
}
```
